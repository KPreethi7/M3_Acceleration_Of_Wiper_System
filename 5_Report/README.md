# ABSTRACT

The windshield wiper system of passenger cars comprises three major subsystems: two wipers and their arms; a mechanism; and an electric motor. This paper presents a study on the dynamic coupling effect among these subsystems for the purpose of a better system design. Each wiper arm is modelled as a rotating cantilever beam with a lumped mass (the mass of the wiper) at its tip where a friction force is applied. The mechanism, which transmits power from the motor to the roots of the wiper arms, is treated as two connected four-bar linkages with rigid members. The electric motor drives the system with varying rotating torque and speed as its load due to the motion of arms and linkages changes with time.

# INTRODUCTION

The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

STM32 CUBE IDE

# COMPONENTS

STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD

# DESCRIPTION

# STM32F407VG

The STM32F407 Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities to make it simple for users to create audio-based applications. It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector.Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features have been added to the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.

# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER

-->In a LQFP100 package, the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM.

-->On-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A on STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 (new order code)

-->USB ST-LINK with three separate interfaces and re-enumeration capability.

-->Virtual Com port Debug port (with new order code only)

-->Large-scale storage (with new order code only)

-->Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source.

-->3 V and 5 V external application power supply

# USES

This Microcontroller is utilised in printing and scanning machines ,heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems.
This module can be found in a variety of household products.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE

Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again  the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.
